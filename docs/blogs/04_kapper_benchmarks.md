# Kapper benchmarks - how does Kapper 1.3 compare to the competition?

Kapper is a lightweight Kotlin ORM library designed to be simple and idiomatic.
Unlike other ORM libraries, such as Hibernate and Ktorm, Kapper avoids being a leaky abstraction over SQL.
Instead, it embraces SQL as the optimal language for database operations, offering a straightforward, idiomatic API to reduce boilerplate code.

But how does Kapper's performance measure up against its competitors?

## TL;DR

I recently benchmarked Kapper 1.3 against raw JDBC, Hibernate, and Ktorm as a precursor to optimization work.
I feared disappointing results, especially given the potential for improving its reflection-based mapping.
However, the outcomes were better than expected:

- Kapper pretty much matches _raw_ JDBC performance when using manual mapping.
- Auto-mapping introduces a small penalty of a few microseconds per conversion.
While this is slightly slower than Hibernate, it is significantly faster than Ktorm.
- Optimizing the reflection-based mapper is less urgent than initially anticipated.

## Benchmarking

Benchmarking is often divisive, so Iâ€™ve taken care to be transparent about the methodology and results.

The goal of these benchmarks wasnâ€™t to measure Kapperâ€™s absolute performance but to evaluate its relative performance against other libraries.
I used the [Java Microbenchmark Harness](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) (JMH), a trusted tool for JVM-based microbenchmarks, which accounts for pitfalls like dead code elimination, constant folding, and JVM warm-up.

I tested the latest library versions at the time of writing:

- **Kapper**: 1.3.0
- **Hibernate**: 6.6.11
- **Ktorm**: 4.1.1

The benchmark code resides in Kapperâ€™s `benchmark` module, and Iâ€™ve published the results [here](https://github.com/driessamyn/kapper-benchmark-results/tree/kapper-1.3-results/results/1.3).

### Environment

Benchmarks ran on an M3 MacBook Air (16GB RAM).
While a dedicated server with a fixed configuration would be more ideal, this setup suffices for relative performance comparisons.
Tests were repeated multiple times to minimize outliers.
If anyone wants to sponsor a dedicated benchmarking environment, let me know! ðŸ˜‰

### Benchmarking Process

The benchmark suite consisted of the following elements:

- **`BenchmarkStrategy` interface**: Specifies methods to benchmark for each library:
  - `findById`: Select a single row by ID and map it to a DTO.
  - `find100Heroes`: Select 100 rows and map them to a DTO.
  - `findHeroBattles`: Execute a join query and map the results to a DTO.
  - `insertNewHero`: Insert a single row into a table.
  - `updateHero`: Update a single row in a table.
- **Library Implementations**:
  - Two strategies for Kapper: one with auto-mapping and one with manual mapping.
  - Hibernate and Ktorm implementations.
- `KapperBenchmark`: Runs benchmarks for each strategy, exercising all interface methods.

Each benchmark was tested against both PostgreSQL and SQLite (in-memory) databases.
SQLite tests minimized I/O latency, focusing on library performance.
However, this article focuses on PostgreSQL results for realism.

The database schema included three tables modeling superheroes, villains, and battles.

### JMH Parameters

- `forks=3` - The 'forks' parameter instructs JMH to run each benchmark in 3 separate JVM instances.
This provides more reliable results by mitigating the effects of JVM-specific optimizations and ensures the benchmarks aren't influenced by artifacts from previous benchmark runs.
- `iterations=5` - Each benchmark is executed 5 times in succession within each fork.
This helps to establish statistical confidence in the results by providing multiple measurement samples.
- `time_on_iteration="5s"` - Each iteration runs for 5 seconds, during which JMH collects multiple measurement samples.
This longer measurement window helps smooth out any momentary performance fluctuations.
- `warmup_time="2s"` - Before the actual measurement begins, JMH runs the benchmark for 2 seconds to 'warm up' the JVM.
This ensures that the JVM's just-in-time compiler has had time to optimize the code, simulating the steady-state performance that would be experienced in a real application rather than measuring cold-start performance.

## The Results

### Find by ID

```

For this benchmark, a single row is selected from one database table, selected by ID (its primary key).
The record is then converted to a DTO, a Kotlin data class in this case.

Kapperâ€™s manual mapping matches _raw_ JDBC, incurring only a 1-2 microsecond penalty.
Auto-mapping adds a ~5 microsecond overhead but remains competitive with Hibernate.
Ktorm lags significantly, averaging 12x slower than Kapperâ€™s auto-mapping.

### Select 100 records

![Find 100 graph](https://github.com/driessamyn/kapper-benchmark-results/blob/main/results/1.3/01/graphs/find100.png?raw=true)

```csv
Benchmark                        (databaseType)          (library)   Mode  Cnt     Score     Error  Units 
KapperBenchmark.find100              POSTGRESQL               JDBC   avgt   15    85.867 Â±   0.994  us/op
KapperBenchmark.find100              POSTGRESQL             KAPPER   avgt   15   330.150 Â± 155.284  us/op
KapperBenchmark.find100              POSTGRESQL  KAPPER-NO-AUTOMAP   avgt   15    86.755 Â±   0.295  us/op
KapperBenchmark.find100              POSTGRESQL          HIBERNATE   avgt   15   123.994 Â±   0.964  us/op
KapperBenchmark.find100              POSTGRESQL              KTORM   avgt   15   907.302 Â± 139.134  us/op
```

Similar trends emerge when selecting 100 rows.
Kapperâ€™s manual mapping nearly matches raw JDBC.
Auto-mapping adds a performance cost, but Kapper still outperforms Ktorm significantly.

### Selecting data using a simple join

![Simple join graph](https://github.com/driessamyn/kapper-benchmark-results/blob/main/results/1.3/01/graphs/simplejoin.png?raw=true)

```csv
Benchmark                        (databaseType)          (library)   Mode  Cnt     Score     Error  Units  
KapperBenchmark.simpleJoin           POSTGRESQL               JDBC   avgt   15    91.490 Â±   1.017  us/op
KapperBenchmark.simpleJoin           POSTGRESQL             KAPPER   avgt   15    97.432 Â±   0.592  us/op
KapperBenchmark.simpleJoin           POSTGRESQL  KAPPER-NO-AUTOMAP   avgt   15    92.780 Â±   0.579  us/op
KapperBenchmark.simpleJoin           POSTGRESQL          HIBERNATE   avgt   15   165.602 Â±   2.178  us/op
KapperBenchmark.simpleJoin           POSTGRESQL              KTORM   avgt   15  1103.603 Â± 760.116  us/op
```

The last variation of the "read" benchmark uses a simple JOIN query to select a single row from 3 tables in the DB:

```sql
SELECT s.name as superhero, v.name as villain, b.battle_date as date
FROM super_heroes as s
INNER JOIN battles as b on s.id = b.super_hero_id
INNER JOIN villains as v on v.id = b.villain_id
WHERE s.id = ? 
```

In this benchmark, Kapperâ€™s manual mapping again matches raw JDBC.
Auto-mapping incurs a small penalty but outperforms Hibernate and significantly outpaces Ktorm.

### Inserting and Updating Records

#### Insert

![Insert single row graph](https://github.com/driessamyn/kapper-benchmark-results/blob/main/results/1.3/01/graphs/insertsinglerow.png?raw=true)

```csv
Benchmark                        (databaseType)          (library)   Mode  Cnt     Score     Error  Units  
KapperBenchmark.insertSingleRow      POSTGRESQL               JDBC   avgt   15    53.077 Â±   0.721  us/op
KapperBenchmark.insertSingleRow      POSTGRESQL             KAPPER   avgt   15    54.457 Â±   0.957  us/op
KapperBenchmark.insertSingleRow      POSTGRESQL  KAPPER-NO-AUTOMAP   avgt   15    54.347 Â±   0.662  us/op
KapperBenchmark.insertSingleRow      POSTGRESQL          HIBERNATE   avgt   15   162.638 Â±   1.792  us/op
KapperBenchmark.insertSingleRow      POSTGRESQL              KTORM   avgt   15   345.546 Â± 331.779  us/op 
```

Moving onto the write operations, there are no surprises. Kapper's performance is similar to using _raw_ JDBC.
In this case, there is no difference between the 2 kapper benchmark results, and that is because Kapper does not yet support auto-mapping for the `execute` API.
Hibernate performs around 3 times slower, and Ktorm slower again, however, the difference is less pronounced than for the read benchmarks.

#### Updating a record, the odd one out

![Updating a single row](https://github.com/driessamyn/kapper-benchmark-results/blob/main/results/1.3/01/graphs/updatesinglerow.png?raw=true)

```csv
Benchmark                        (databaseType)          (library)   Mode  Cnt     Score     Error  Units   
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow      POSTGRESQL               JDBC   avgt   15   707.729 Â± 124.671  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow      POSTGRESQL             KAPPER   avgt   15   705.396 Â± 118.716  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow      POSTGRESQL  KAPPER-NO-AUTOMAP   avgt   15   705.013 Â± 121.060  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow      POSTGRESQL          HIBERNATE   avgt   15   105.266 Â±   2.165  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow      POSTGRESQL              KTORM   avgt   15   846.170 Â± 166.406  us/op 
```

Results for the last benchmark, updating a single row, has me puzzled. I was expecting these to be very similar to inserting a record, however, it is significantly slower for all libraries, except Hibernate, for which the update is faster than the insert, and more curiously a lot faster even than using _raw_ JDBC.
When seeing these results, I was convinced this was a blib, so repeated the benchmark run a few times to validate, but I am seeing similar results for all.

Curiously, the SQLITE results look more like what I was expecting:

```csv
Benchmark                        (databaseType)          (library)   Mode  Cnt     Score     Error  Units
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow          SQLITE               JDBC   avgt   15     2.191 Â±   0.032  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow          SQLITE             KAPPER   avgt   15     3.004 Â±   0.044  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow          SQLITE  KAPPER-NO-AUTOMAP   avgt   15     3.030 Â±   0.018  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow          SQLITE          HIBERNATE   avgt   15     7.319 Â±   0.087  us/op
KapperBenchmark.updateSingleRow          SQLITE              KTORM   avgt   15   708.753 Â± 175.757  us/op
```

This anomaly warrants deeper investigation.
I've confirmed the benchmark implementation is correct, and the SQLite results support my expectation that updates should perform similarly to inserts.
This PostgreSQL-specific behavior will be the subject of future profiling and analysis, and if Hibernate has some magic sauce here, I will be sure to copy it, but more likely I am missing something.
If anybody has any ideas, let me know ;) 

## Conclusion

Benchmarking kapper was actually a lot of fun, and the JMH library is a great tool for this.
I was fearful of what I would find, but the results are better than I expected, and I am happy to see that Kapper's performance can be on par with _raw_ JDBC.
I was expecting to do some optimisations to the reflection based mapping, and that is still the plan, but this doesn't seem as urgent as I had feared.

What I can take away from this is:

- Kapper's auto-mapper adds a small single digit microsecond penalty.
This is unsurprising given it is using reflection.
For most use-cases, this will be fine given this is very small fraction of the overall "cost" considering the I/O nature of DB operations.
- If performance is critical, and you are using Kapper, then use manual mapping, it is pretty much as fast as _raw_ JDBC but still gives you the benefits of Kapper's API to reduce boilerplate code.
- Hibernate is a little faster than Kapper when using the auto-mapper, but not as fast as when using manual mapping.
It is also much harder to use and suffers from the leaky abstraction issue.
- Ktorm is significantly slower than Kapper and Hibernate.

While Kapper's auto-mapping performance is already quite good, I plan to optimize it further in upcoming releases and welcome community contributions.

There are several ways you can contribute to making Kapper even better:

- Try running these benchmarks on your own systems and share your results
- Review the benchmark code and suggest improvements or additional test cases
- Help investigate the PostgreSQL update performance anomaly
- Consider contributing to Kapper's development, especially if you have experience with performance optimization or code generation
- Share your experiences using Kapper in real-world applications

The more diverse environments and use cases we can test, the more we can refine Kapper to be both performant and developer-friendly.
